# Regression_with_neural_networks_and_pytorch
This repository contains regression models implemented using artificial neural networks with pytorch.

The datasets used were a database about games and another about used cars. All are in CSV format and encode ISO-8859-1.

Folder **----_notebooks** contains the notebooks developed with the stacks.

# Requirements

 * Check the **requirements.txt** file.


# Use

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gslmota/Regression_with_neural_networks_and_pytorch.git
cd Regression_with_neural_networks_and_pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Results
The implemented regression models have a plus or minus margin of error, around 5% of the general mean.
